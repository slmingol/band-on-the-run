## Adding Songs

To add more songs, edit \`src/utils/gameLogic.js\` and add entries to the \`SONGS\` array:

\`\`\`javascript
{
  title: "Song Title",
  artist: "Artist Name",
  instruments: ["🎸 Guitar", "🥁 Drums", "🎤 Vocals"],
  audioUrl: "/audio/your-song.mp3"
}
\`\`\`

## Audio Files

Currently, the app uses placeholder audio URLs. To add real audio:

1. Create a \`public/audio\` directory
2. Add your audio files (MP3 format recommended)
3. Update the \`audioUrl\` in each song object

For a production app, you would need:
- Separate audio tracks for each instrument
- Logic to layer instruments progressively
- Or use an audio processing library

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real multi-track audio with instrument isolation
- [ ] Multiplayer mode
- [ ] More songs (1000+)
- [ ] Weekly challenges
- [ ] Leaderboards
- [ ] Different difficulty levels
- [ ] Genre-specific modes
- [ ] Spotify/Apple Music integration
